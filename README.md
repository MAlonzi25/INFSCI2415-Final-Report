# Regional Inequality in the U.S. Housing Market

This repository contains the final project for **INFSCI 2415 – Information Visualization**.

## 📊 Project Overview
The project investigates regional disparities in U.S. housing prices using listing-level real estate data.  
A violin-plot-based visualization is used to compare price distributions across four U.S. regions:
- Midwest
- Northeast
- South
- West

## 🧠 Key Findings
- The West has the highest housing prices and the widest variability.
- The Midwest is the most affordable region overall.
- The South shows substantial internal price variation.
- The Northeast remains consistently high-priced with moderate dispersion.
